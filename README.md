# Card-Verification
This repository contains a program in both C and Python that accepts a credit card number as input and will output the company of the card (AMEX, Mastercard, or Visa) or if it is invalid. The program starts by calculating the checksum of the card and if the checksum is 0 continues to determine which company the card is from or if it is still invalid.
# Usage
After compiling the program simply run "./credit" for the program in C or "python credit.py" for the python program. After running this the program will accept a number as user input and print whether the card is invalid or a AMEX, Mastercard, or Visa card.
